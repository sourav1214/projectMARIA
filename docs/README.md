# projectMARIA
This is the repository of the project MARIA. MARIA is a Multiple Application Robotic Intelligent Assistant, who will be able to perform a wide array of tasks.

In recent years the applications of robots have extended in various new fields. Todayâ€™s robots have come out from the factories and science fiction movies to our social life. As another new effort towards this we are proposing to make an AI based low cost advanced humanoid for the application in service and security. The proposed project will offer opportunities for our students to get work experience on a real life robotic system. 

Proposed humanoid will be a four feet long multi functional professional service robot. Automatic obstacle avoidance, navigation, route planning will be provided as a capability. It may be used to welcome the guests, communicate and coordinate activities in Restaurant, Hotel Bar, Cafe & all kind of events. It will hear voice, recognise and move around autonomously. Additionally, it will be equipped with advanced face recognition technology, to identify different character traits to act as security robot.
